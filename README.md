# TO DO
SHINYAPP
1) Linear and GAM Models Step 4 --> Add some text explaining:
                                   - Remove less significant predictors    
                                   - Introduce interactions between covariates
                                   - Log tranform covariates
                                   - Step AIC
                                   - refactoring covaraites
                                   - VIF
                                   - introduce best model and resiuduals analysis     [ SANDRO ]

2) Linear and GAM Models Step 5 --> Polynomial Regression
                                    - Step AIC
                                   - refactoring covaraites
                                   - VIF  [ SANDRO ]
                                    
4) Linear and GAM Models Step 6 --> Ridge and Lasso   [ LUCA ]
5) Linear and GAM Models Step 7 --> Splines  [ PRANAY ]
6) Linear and GAM Models Step 8 --> GAMs  [ PRANAY ]
7) Other models (find a better name!!!) --> -MARS, trees , random forest   [ LUCA ]
8) Conclusion [ ANNALISA ]


# check number of occurences for NA district estimations saturated model!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# check if it's needed to write something in each page

- splines (with mostly correlated vars, with all vars, with most significant vars, with interaction, step AIC, categorical c_breastf)
- GAM (most correlated vars, complete, removed less significant vars, interaction, categorical, linearized, ANOVA to compare different models)
