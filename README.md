# TO DO
SHINYAPP
1) Linear and GAM Models Step 4 --> Add some text explaining:
                                   - Remove less significant predictors    
                                   - Introduce interactions between covariates
                                   - Log tranform covariates
                                   - Step AIC
                                   - refactoring covaraites
                                   - VIF
                                   - introduce best model and resiuduals analysis     

2) Linear and GAM Models Step 5 --> Polynomial Regression
                                    - Step AIC
                                   - refactoring covaraites
                                   - VIF
                                    
4) Linear and GAM Models Step 6 --> Ridge and Lasso   [ LUCA ]
5) Linear and GAM Models Step 7 --> Splines
6) Linear and GAM Models Step 8 --> GAMs
7) Other models (find a better name!!!) --> -MARS, trees , random forest   [ LUCA ]
8) Conclusion
